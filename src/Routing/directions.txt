---------------Pet Page-------------------

-	There should be a button for the owner of pet to return the pet to the adoption center (if they are fostering the pet or adopted it)
-	If the person is not the owner they should see a button to adopt and a button to foster. (If they are already fostering, they should see a button to adopt)
-	There should be an additional button to save for later (Or unsave if already saved)

------------Admin Pages------------



Dashboard

Components: 
-	List of all the users in the database (pet owners and administrators) 
-	Clicking on a user should display all the pets that the user owns along with all of their profile details so the administrators can contact the user. 

-	List of all pets and ability to go to the pet page and edit. (The edit should be just like adding a pet but with the details already displayed there)
